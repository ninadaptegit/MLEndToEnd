# ðŸ§  End-to-End Machine Learning Project â€” Chapter 2

This project is a complete implementation of the **end-to-end machine learning workflow** as covered in Chapter 2 of *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron.

It walks through every stage of a real-world ML project, from data acquisition to model deployment readiness, using the **California Housing dataset**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Steps

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Fetch the California Housing dataset from external sources.
2. **Data Exploration**
   - Visualize distributions, correlations, and geographical data.
3. **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**
   - Handle missing values, categorical features, and feature scaling.
4. **Model Selection**
   - Train multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Use cross-validation, RMSE, grid search, and randomized search.
6. **Final Model and Testing**
   - Evaluate on a hold-out test set.
